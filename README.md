## ReadyForTomorrow (R4T)

R4T is a PWA built to give users a summary of their schedule for tomorrow. So users are well aware of their plans and are ready to tackle tomorrow.

TODO:

- refactor button code
- Clean up useEffects into hooks
- Refine user journey
- Only render "show" button when fetch response has finished
- re-enable PWA
